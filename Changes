POE::Component::SmokeBox ChangeLog
==================================

0.01_05 Wed Oct  8 10:37:11 BST 2008
	- Changed the API for ::Job and ::JobQueue. We don't
	  define smokers in the Job object now, this was doomed
	  to fatal failure.

0.01_04	Tue Oct  7 17:20:13 BST 2008
	- Added loop detection to ::Backend 

0.01_03	Fri Oct  3 13:25:26 BST 2008
	- Fixed bug in JobQueue, we were only processing
	  the first job that was submitted. Doh.

0.01_02	Fri Oct  3 12:10:18 BST 2008
	- Added PERL5_SMOKEBOX_DEBUG env to ::Backend

0.01_01	Mon Sep  8 12:47:26 BST 2008
	- Initial public developer release
