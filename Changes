	  and certain fbsd boxen.

	- Amended some of the longer running tests.

0.01_07	Fri Oct 10 22:46:40 BST 2008
	- Trying to see if it is a problem with older T::H for
	  hangs on certain CPAN tester configurations.

0.01_06	Wed Oct  8 16:24:59 BST 2008

	- Added loop detection to ::Backend 

0.01_03	Fri Oct  3 13:25:26 BST 2008
	- Fixed bug in JobQueue, we were only processing
	  the first job that was submitted. Doh.

	- Added PERL5_SMOKEBOX_DEBUG env to ::Backend

0.01_01	Mon Sep  8 12:47:26 BST 2008
